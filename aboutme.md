I am De-Wang Xu, a PhD student of department of astronomy of Peking University. I am working on galaxies. I love galaxies!

### My story

Our group have three big topics, morphology, structure and kinematics. Now, maybe we can select one topic from these three topics and we can rank orders acoording to the number of people on each topic. Then, just half of the abstracts should be submitted on February 19 and half of that can be submitted later. Below is a simple decription of these three topics. Any suggestions about the discussion organization are welcome!

## Morphology：

* It mainly refers to the shape of galaxies, e.g., is the galaxy an elliptical, a S0 galaxy or a spiral galaxy; if there is a bar in the galaxy, if the galaxy is interacting/mergering with other galaxy.

* It mainly refers to visual estimates to classify galaxies into morphological types, i.e., elliptical/lenticular(S0)/spiral galaxies/peculiars (e.g., extended stellar halos, warps, shells and tidal tails). The spiral galaxies can be further subdivided into spirals with or without a bar.

## Structure：

* It refers to quantitative measurement on the profiles of galaxies. Such as Sérsic index, bulge-to-disk ratio, bulge-disk(or other structure of galaxy, such as bar) decomposition, the profile itself and so on.

* It refers to quantitative measurements of galaxies including both parametric fitting and non-parametric measurements, e.g., the multicomponent decompositions, bulge-to-total light ratio $B/T$, global Sersic index, CAS system(concentration index, asymmetry, clumpiness), $M_{20}$-Gini and so on.

## Kinematic：

* It refers to the rotation curve of stellar component or gas, angular momentum and so on.

## Something we can talk about:

* We can talk about the relationship among morphology, structure and kinemetics.

* For all these three parts, we can talk about the relationshaip between them and enviroment, star formation rate and so on.

* We can talk about the evolution of these three properties, i.e., from high-z to low-z.
